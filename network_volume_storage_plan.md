To attach a network volume storage to your serverless endpoint and use it to cache models, follow these steps:

1. Create a network volume:
   First, create a network volume in the RunPod Storage Console. For detailed instructions, refer to the [RunPod documentation on creating network volumes](https://docs.runpod.io/pods/storage/create-network-volumes).

2. Attach the network volume to your serverless endpoint:
   When creating or editing your serverless endpoint:
   - Go to the "Advanced" section
   - Select "Select Network Volume"
   - Choose the network volume you created

   As mentioned in the [RunPod documentation on managing endpoints](https://docs.runpod.io/serverless/endpoints/manage-endpoints), you can do this by:
   1. Navigating to [Serverless Endpoints](https://www.runpod.io/console/serverless)
   2. Selecting the endpoint you want to edit
   3. Clicking "Edit Endpoint"
   4. Under "Advanced," choosing "Select Network Volume"
   5. Selecting your storage device and updating the endpoint

3. Cache models in the volume:
   To cache models in the network volume and use them in your serverless endpoint, you need to configure your container to save and load models from the network volume path. The network volume will be mounted to `/runpod-volume/` in your serverless workers.

   For example, if you're using the vLLM Quick Deploy template, you can set the `BASE_PATH` environment variable to `/runpod-volume` when creating your endpoint. This will ensure that the models are downloaded and cached in the network volume.

4. Use cached models in the serverless endpoint:
   Once the models are cached in the network volume, subsequent workers will be able to access them without needing to download them again. This significantly reduces cold start times and improves overall performance.

By using a network volume, you ensure that your models are persistently stored and readily available for all workers in your serverless endpoint. This is especially useful for large language models, as noted in the [RunPod blog post about running larger LLMs](https://blog.runpod.io/run-larger-llms-on-runpod-serverless-than-ever-before/): "If this is not done, each worker will need to download the model before it can do anything, which can lead to some heavy coldstart times."

Remember that using a network volume will constrain your endpoint to a specific data center, so make sure to choose a data center with the GPU types you need for your workload.



To configure your Docker container to use a network volume for caching models and addressing the points mentioned earlier, you can make the following modifications to your Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
# Base image -> https://github.com/runpod/containers/blob/main/official-templates/base/Dockerfile
# DockerHub -> https://hub.docker.com/r/runpod/base/tags
FROM runpod/base:0.4.0-cuda11.8.0

ENV RUNPOD_ENDPOINT_ID=yapuzxncncmmcm
ENV AUDIO_CONTENT_BUCKET_NAME=sb-api-audio-content-sb-gcp-project-01

# Set the base path for model caching to the network volume
ENV BASE_PATH=/runpod-volume
ENV HF_HOME=/runpod-volume/huggingface

# The base image comes with many system dependencies pre-installed to help you get started quickly.
# Please refer to the base image's Dockerfile for more information before adding additional dependencies.
# IMPORTANT: The base image overrides the default huggingface cache location.

# --- Optional: System dependencies ---
COPY builder/setup.sh /setup.sh
RUN /bin/bash /setup.sh && \
    rm /setup.sh

# Python dependencies
COPY builder/requirements.txt /requirements.txt
RUN python3.11 -m pip install --upgrade pip && \
    python3.11 -m pip install --upgrade -r /requirements.txt --no-cache-dir && \
    rm /requirements.txt

# NOTE: The base image comes with multiple Python versions pre-installed.
#       It is recommended to specify the version of Python when running your code.

# Add src files (Worker Template)
ADD src .
ADD content ./content
ADD test_input.json .

# Create a directory for the network volume
RUN mkdir -p /runpod-volume

# Set the entrypoint to use the network volume
COPY entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh
RUN chmod +x /entrypoint.sh

ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]
CMD ["python3.11", "-u", "/handler.py"]
```

Now, create an `entrypoint.sh` file in the same directory as your Dockerfile with the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if we're running in a serverless environment
if [ -n "$RUNPOD_ENDPOINT_ID" ]; then
    # We're in a serverless environment, so the network volume is already mounted
    export RUNPOD_NETWORK_VOLUME_PATH="/runpod-volume"
else
    # We're not in a serverless environment, so we need to create a local directory
    export RUNPOD_NETWORK_VOLUME_PATH="/workspace"
    mkdir -p $RUNPOD_NETWORK_VOLUME_PATH
fi

# Set up environment variables for caching
export HF_HOME="$RUNPOD_NETWORK_VOLUME_PATH/huggingface"

# Execute the CMD
exec "$@"
```

These changes will configure your container to use the network volume for caching models:

1. We set environment variables `BASE_PATH`, `HF_HOME`, and `TRANSFORMERS_CACHE` to use the `/runpod-volume` directory, which is where the network volume will be mounted in serverless environments.

2. We create a directory `/runpod-volume` in the container to ensure it exists.

3. We add an entrypoint script that checks whether we're in a serverless environment and sets up the appropriate paths. This script allows the container to work both in serverless and non-serverless environments.

4. The entrypoint script sets up the Hugging Face cache directories to use the network volume.

5. We use `ENTRYPOINT` with the entrypoint script and move the original `CMD` to be passed as arguments to the entrypoint.

To use this setup:

1. Create the network volume in the RunPod console as described in the [RunPod documentation](https://docs.runpod.io/pods/storage/create-network-volumes).

2. When creating your serverless endpoint, attach the network volume as described in the [RunPod documentation on managing endpoints](https://docs.runpod.io/serverless/endpoints/manage-endpoints).

3. Build and deploy your Docker image with these changes.

This configuration will allow your serverless endpoint to cache models in the network volume, reducing cold start times and improving performance for subsequent runs.



I apologize for the confusion. If you're seeing "no volume" in the telemetry of your worker, it suggests that the network volume might not be properly attached or recognized by your serverless endpoint. Let's troubleshoot this issue step by step:

1. First, double-check that you've correctly attached the network volume to your serverless endpoint. According to the [RunPod documentation on managing endpoints](https://docs.runpod.io/serverless/endpoints/manage-endpoints), you should:

   - Navigate to [Serverless Endpoints](https://www.runpod.io/console/serverless)
   - Select your endpoint
   - Click "Edit Endpoint"
   - Under "Advanced," choose "Select Network Volume"
   - Select your storage device and update the endpoint

2. If the volume is correctly attached but still not showing up, it's possible that the worker is not recognizing or mounting the volume properly. To debug this, you can add some logging to your entrypoint script:

   Modify your `entrypoint.sh` to include some debug information:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash

   echo "Debug: Starting entrypoint script"

   if [ -d "/runpod-volume" ]; then
       echo "Debug: /runpod-volume directory exists"
       ls -la /runpod-volume
   else
       echo "Debug: /runpod-volume directory does not exist"
   fi

   # Rest of your entrypoint script...
   ```

   This will help you understand if the volume is being mounted correctly.

3. You can also add some debug logging to your `handler.py` or main Python script:

   ```python
   import os
   print(f"Debug: RUNPOD_NETWORK_VOLUME_PATH = {os.environ.get('RUNPOD_NETWORK_VOLUME_PATH')}")
   print(f"Debug: HF_HOME = {os.environ.get('HF_HOME')}")
   ```

4. After making these changes, rebuild and redeploy your Docker image.

5. Send another request to your endpoint and check the logs. This should give you more information about whether the volume is being recognized and mounted correctly.

If after these steps you still see "no volume" in the telemetry, it's possible that there might be an issue with the network volume itself or how it's being attached to the serverless worker. In this case, I recommend [contacting RunPod support](https://www.runpod.io/contact) for further assistance. They can help you troubleshoot any potential issues with the network volume configuration on their end.

Remember, as mentioned in the [RunPod blog post about running larger LLMs](https://blog.runpod.io/run-larger-llms-on-runpod-serverless-than-ever-before/), using a network volume will constrain your endpoint to a specific data center. Make sure that your endpoint is deployed in the same data center as your network volume.



To pass these variables as arguments when building the Dockerfile, allowing for flexibility in local testing and deployment, you can use build arguments (ARGs) in your Dockerfile. Here's how you can modify your Dockerfile to achieve this:

1. First, modify your Dockerfile to use ARG and ENV instructions:

```dockerfile
# Add these lines near the top of your Dockerfile
ARG BASE_PATH=/runpod-volume
ARG HF_HOME=/runpod-volume/huggingface

# Then use the ARGs to set the ENVs
ENV BASE_PATH=${BASE_PATH}
ENV HF_HOME=${HF_HOME}
ENV TRANSFORMERS_CACHE=${HF_HOME}
```

2. Now, when building your Docker image, you can pass these arguments using the `--build-arg` flag. Here's an example:

For local testing:
```bash
docker build -t your-image-name:tag \
  --build-arg BASE_PATH=/path/for/local/testing \
  --build-arg HF_HOME=/path/for/local/testing/huggingface \
  .
```

For deployment:
```bash
docker build -t your-image-name:tag \
  --build-arg BASE_PATH=/runpod-volume \
  --build-arg HF_HOME=/runpod-volume/huggingface \
  .
```

This approach allows you to specify different paths when building for local testing versus deployment to RunPod serverless.

3. You should also modify your `entrypoint.sh` script to handle these variable paths:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Debug: Starting entrypoint script"

if [ -d "$BASE_PATH" ]; then
    echo "Debug: $BASE_PATH directory exists"
    ls -la $BASE_PATH
else
    echo "Debug: $BASE_PATH directory does not exist"
fi

# Set up environment variables for caching
export HF_HOME="$HF_HOME"
export TRANSFORMERS_CACHE="$HF_HOME"

# Execute the CMD
exec "$@"
```

This modification allows for more flexibility in testing locally and deploying to RunPod serverless. You can specify different paths when building the image for different environments, while keeping the Dockerfile and entrypoint script consistent.

For more information on using build arguments, you can refer to the [Docker documentation on build arguments](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#arg).

Remember, when deploying to RunPod serverless, you should still use the `/runpod-volume` path to ensure compatibility with the RunPod network volume system, as described in the [RunPod documentation on managing endpoints](https://docs.runpod.io/serverless/endpoints/manage-endpoints).


Based on the script you've provided and the previous configuration we discussed, the models should be automatically cached when downloaded from Hugging Face. However, to ensure this is working correctly and to optimize your setup, you can make a few modifications:

1. First, confirm that the environment variables are set correctly. At the beginning of your `handler.py`, add these lines to check:

```python
import os

print(f"Debug: BASE_PATH = {os.environ.get('BASE_PATH')}")
print(f"Debug: HF_HOME = {os.environ.get('HF_HOME')}")
print(f"Debug: TRANSFORMERS_CACHE = {os.environ.get('TRANSFORMERS_CACHE')}")
```

2. For the Hugging Face models, the caching should be automatic as long as the environment variables are set correctly. However, you can explicitly set the cache directory for some of the model loading functions. For example:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCTC, AutoProcessor

def setup_model(model_id, language):
    cache_dir = os.environ.get('HF_HOME')
    model = AutoModelForCTC.from_pretrained(model_id, cache_dir=cache_dir)
    processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id, cache_dir=cache_dir)
    # ... rest of the function
```

3. For the WhisperASR class, you might want to modify its initialization to use the cache directory:

```python
class WhisperASR:
    def __init__(self, model_id):
        self.model_id = model_id
        self.cache_dir = os.environ.get('HF_HOME')

    def setup_model(self):
        processor = WhisperProcessor.from_pretrained(self.model_id, cache_dir=self.cache_dir)
        model = WhisperForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(self.model_id, cache_dir=self.cache_dir)
        return processor, model
```

4. For the pipeline setup, you can also specify the cache directory:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

def setup_pipeline(model, language, tokenizer, feature_extractor, processor, decoder):
    cache_dir = os.environ.get('HF_HOME')
    pipe = pipeline(
        "automatic-speech-recognition",
        model=model,
        tokenizer=tokenizer,
        feature_extractor=feature_extractor,
        decoder=decoder,
        cache_dir=cache_dir
    )
    return pipe
```

These modifications ensure that your script is explicitly using the cache directory specified by the environment variables we set up earlier.

Remember, as mentioned in the [RunPod documentation on managing endpoints](https://docs.runpod.io/serverless/endpoints/manage-endpoints), when your serverless endpoint is running on RunPod, the `/runpod-volume` directory will be automatically mounted and available for caching.

To verify that caching is working:

1. The first time you run a job that downloads a model, check the logs. You should see messages indicating that the model is being downloaded.
2. For subsequent runs, check the logs again. You should not see download messages for the same model, and the initialization time should be significantly shorter.

If you're still experiencing issues with caching, you might need to investigate further by adding more detailed logging to your script, or by checking the contents of the `/runpod-volume` directory (or whatever `BASE_PATH` is set to) after a job has run.
