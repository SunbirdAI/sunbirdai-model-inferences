you can listen to our lectures like the wind in the sky that makes the dot backup uganda shoots them when you listen to us and listen to this lectures like the sound recorded on my radio em down love or in devine video music library that is dying how many come from the school to attend your lectures and how many come from the city council school the city education office and the primary schools are located on the main road from the church to the university in the late primary school behind the catholic cathedral and demonstration primary school behind the school. to help each child to have all the necessary support where even though I am speaking English, I am a teacher in our fourth-grade classroom today in a situation that affects other children in the classroom and not the two leading to the issue of how to put you in the classroom because we are going to repeat the story that shows that when we graduate, we are going to be in our homes where our children are watching that our third lecture on dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis dis today we are going to talk about what is called di and the problems affecting our children in the first place and the body that represents attention deficit is that the child has three symptoms most commonly associated with attention deficit disorder those with a disability have a problem with attention deficit disorder, but they also have a problem with attention deficit disorder, which is a sign that not all children in school are being taught how to behave and how to behave the teacher brings them to where they should plan on how to behave and teach them how to focus their time and energy more than other children I know who they are but we teach them how to focus their energy that's why we are here to help you with our first lesson we use to call your children today because they are too old and too lazy to do things in the past how can we help teachers to know how to behave in school and at home now let us look at the signs you see in children d should not be important signs i can't focus on the first and third things without thinking about it let's start to understand each of them paractivity that is known to be the most exciting or doing things in the world should be slowly and slowly all of them have been silent in some way but they don't even ask where they are going to get a life you think we have your children who are in school but we also understand from where they come from and how we can help them let's go and see what we can do next apart from the past and impulsivity as a parent, you can talk to your child before the end of the lesson about what it means to be a child who knows what they are talking about in a way that comes to them. We have these children with us and we know what they are doing. For example, if you use discipline to help your child change the lesson, you get a lot of ideas on what to do in the third lesson the reason is that the only time the research team considers themselves is when they are going through whatever is going on let's say your child's lights are close to your child's lights or they are talking about you doing other things that most of us don't do when someone is talking about people not understanding people leaving the meeting indicates that I have a problem or even a child who shows signs of being involved the younger one usually goes with one or two symptoms to tell us that the child has all the time to do something or we have all the time to do something else but if it's too late for the child to go to school or it's too late for the child to see the problems we're facing and hear from the person who's living with me and say that I have a problem with the age of the child it has been difficult for me to do my teacher's work at home all the time and to think about what is important to me because I have to write down all the things I have to do every day so that I don't have to go to work every night and I don't have to go to school every night and I don't have to go to school every night and I don't have to go to school every night and I don't have to the problem with teachers is that I don't have a reason to believe in a person who has a belief in men but you can also make a difference like the other problems we talked about in this article but what about the problem of the hidden parts of the brain? there is a lot of electricity going on in the brain at the same time as there is a lot of electricity going on in the brain at the same time there is a lot of electricity going on in the brain at the same time there is a lot of electricity going on in the brain at the same time there is a lot of electricity going on in the brain at the same time there is a lot of electricity going on in the brain at the same time there or even before the birth of the child we talked about the causes of the problem in our previous lesson that the parents' actions during the lockdown are necessary and the accident where the child grows or dies but it may be more so because it is important to understand how parents can help the child if possible and how to help the children with d school as well as the children who can stop them from going to school because they don't know how to distribute books in the class looking at the child's body more than the size of the child's body to make sure that the child's study area is not too small to give them a lot of work to get their attention so that they can identify the child's identity so that when you teach the teacher's message, the child's mind will be focused so that they don't have time to teach so that they don't have time to help the children in the workshop and they chose to face challenges in their faith to understand how to teach them how difficult it can be to understand the challenges and help them to learn and to smile at the challenges they face as a parent and as a teacher we pray that you don't stop listening to your lessons because the lessons can also be used to help us focus on how we communicate according to our needs we have provided a list of activities that can help children to do a lot of work that comes from helping your child if you give them a list of activities to do in a way that is similar to a worker's schedule if you can write it down it can also help to remind them of the work they have done to remind them of the work they have to do and to thank them for it doing everything on your children because of their mistakes doesn't help the child's problems but we need to help them to learn from their mistakes and it's very important if you put them to work you're still trying to help them to be able to do the work and do the work you're doing and give them five minutes to rest after the important lesson or the same size you need to see that each child has more than the others you have to do a lot of work at the same time, such as washing the children's clothes, washing the children's clothes, washing the children's clothes, washing the children's clothes, washing the children's clothes, washing the children's clothes, washing the children's clothes, washing the children's clothes, washing the children's clothes, washing the children's clothes, washing the with three or more children, they usually get up because their minds go elsewhere or they go where there is a lot of noise and it helps if you leave the child to do the teacher's work at home where you can't sit quietly doing the teacher's work on the radio or on the radio on the other hand, it has been said that children with learning difficulties usually deal with learning difficulties with patience and others will help them to be happy and have a good time knowing that medication will not solve the problem but only reduce the pain and symptoms so that they can focus on protecting the child from this kind of behavior we need to start doing our own research and especially the one in medicine who has been told that it's normal for most people in the army to swallow condoms and it's dangerous to join the army without following the doctor's instructions or it's important to get one and don't think about going anywhere thanks to our fourth session where we tried to help understand the problem and how we can help you listen to us and get information learning from the challenges of education and how we pray that you don't miss us when we see you thank you for teaching all the children a lesson with us on Facebook in the number of seven seven seven seven seven seven seven seven seven eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight"

lectures as a recording of the lectures at the devine video music library in the middle of the town and at your favorite school in the middle of the road and at the men's primary school in the middle of the road behind the catholic church the so-called patience of Christ the King demonstration primary school after school is the secret of our educational knowledge that we have the freedom to share it with our family and neighbors so that if more people hear about the challenges children face in school, we can help our children better pay for their early education so that each child can have all the necessary support for their education it will also work I am a friend this is our first lesson for all children to learn from it and why we are doing this lesson to see what we can do to solve the problems that affect us l have time to explain the problems and we will take time to explain the reasons why I and many others talk about the problems that affect the children and how we can help them so let's start a prayer group for the government agencies that work in Uganda from two thousand years ago to the present day, we have been supporting children with disabilities because we believe that every child today should be given the same opportunities as every other child, that every child has a gift that can be praised and respected, and that children's problems and differences show that we are all human beings to get to the point where they want to say that every child has their own responsibility in education we have to believe that the way to help the child is to provide training for the learning process beyond putting children with different abilities in the same school or the reason is what we are going to talk about in the next forum as a ugandan association we are working with schools to provide training to those who want to be primary school teachers and other interested parties their mission is to send and receive donations so that we can use our homes and all our children but I am still wondering if our program will be extended to all schools in the country where we have the opportunity to provide family planning services to our children and we want the loan to have any kind of evidence of our children in school so that they have a way to help them and they have to reorganize their lessons or add more time to help learners learn how to help other learners other than staying in a classroom where lessons are being taught or after we think that we should do things differently so that our children don't have to be alone so that teachers can do things differently for them for years to come and help them with the lessons they have learned and how we can improve on what we need and how we can help the student who will be the next head of the school instead of supporting each student's needs, we need to ensure that schools are well facilitated if we are not in school, so that we can continue to help all students who are struggling to understand what is happening in the school. information because even in our meetings they often tell us how they feel about us as a group of barkapuganda we also know how they can know if a child is struggling with school activities and how to investigate their problems and who can go to them if we work with teachers but also help those who are in school or trained to join us and those who are going to school to teach the same lessons as the children who are going to school the lecturers in the schools we work with are not here to teach us how to build wealth so that the incoming lecturers can have time to help all students with their problems and unite with knowledge and training districts and all over the country instead of working with children we know that we as a society have made it possible for us to work with other interested parties in the field of education that want each child to be better and that we should work with geniver globle and the members of the community foundation as we can tell them that we love to share with all people that if each person is aware of the challenges we face we will see that we are all part of the solution each child can learn six lessons about the challenges our children are facing when they learn that they are in the air and can also be found in schools like primary school and primary school in the neighborhood so that friends and relatives don't get together because of the pandemic but we don't have to rely on the education of children in the field of education at the time of the pandemic we hear a lot of talk about children who look different from their peers who are told that for various reasons we understand the concept of disability some say that there is something wrong with tobacco let's take some time to understand it let's start with understanding the meaning of the word it comes from not only do we all have a lot of things we want but we also have other things we want other than the fact that we call it important and unreasonable some people argue that personal needs are not important or unique but what we need from different people at different times in our lives is what we do when we go to school and we go to school and we go to school and we go to school and we go to school and we go to school and we go to school and we go to school and we go to school and we go to school and we go to school and we go to school and we go to school and we go to remember that you may have but you may not want or people say that your child has a special need other than the fact that the main thing is that someone needs things other than other people's needs to understand what it means to have a special need for help other than other people's needs so that we don't have a small gap between the basic needs of education and the problems of both parties my classroom has no space for my bicycle and it can be difficult to get into the classroom if I don't go to school with my bicycle and I don't understand what the teacher is teaching me especially if I don't go to school with my bicycle and I don't go to school with my bicycle and I don't go to school with my bicycle and I don't go to school with my bicycle and I don' dislaughter is a term used by doctors to describe a student's inability to read or interpret words and symbols but we should also remember that it is not a sign of intellectual disability he took us to the problem model and I wanted to talk about the issue of how our children are called in Uganda when we call them names that he doesn't think they add anything to their efforts to study in schools and the issue we are talking about is that parents should think about calling their children especially when they fail their exams at home and when they say that they don't understand us we can't tell them how to use it but think about it instead of saying that the child is suffering from a mental disorder, instead of telling us that the children are suffering from a mental disorder, we should tell them that they are more likely to suffer from a mental disorder than other children should be involved in the learning process the first type of learning disability is dyslexia. The second type of learning disability is dyslexia. The third type of learning disability is dyslexia. The fourth type of learning disability is dyslexia. some of the challenges faced by students in the field of literacy and numeracy are difficult to understand and explain because of the challenges they face in the field of literacy and numeracy and the challenges they face in the field of literacy and numeracy. the presence of dyscalculia is a common problem among children with this disorder, and it is important to note that not all children are affected by the disorder and that some need to continue with the teacher's education rather than focusing on the physical and emotional aspects of the disorder inappropriate time as a lesson with all these problems but for children who are not interested in animals the child does not pay attention to everything and focuses on health issues let us see the child's mind will be on everything that is going on and what the parents think it can't be the place where most of the students do things without thinking that can cause the children to be very excited and talk too much and not but I need to be young some of them are drunk with alcohol and don't think they have it and we have so-called problems with them that they don't have a lot of time to look at the children's problems in a way that's not right where I say it's a problem of how a child's strength shows how to behave and it's a problem that should be the same as a child's voice to ask for forgiveness for what they did to they can also show the same signs and symptoms, for example, we bring them all together because to help them, we need to talk about the problem and how to talk to each other when we talk to parents or teachers of children with disabilities how to learn how to behave and think like other people or like other children and life in general not to talk and talk often causes problems that are still there but it is also true that the problem may arise from the fact that the child may show signs of the disease such as fear of seeing people or men and does not think that the child has a problem may make the child appear to be a leader in the field of education such as parents or teachers should not be the ones to the child has malaria and the pathologists do not test for the disease there are many causes of the disease but they are still investigating the causes of the condition such as the doctor's recommendations for antenatal care and the mother's brain development that we are all the same now the cause of the problem may be the problem at home indicating that mothers may have problems with their children's health problems and asking our children what is causing them to suffer in the best way you can like what the child said violence seven two six three seven thank you for listening to our first lesson about one child where we tried our best to help them understand what is wrong with them we think you should listen to them to get information about your challenges in education, we will discuss the challenges of education and we will not miss the opportunity to listen to all the children's lessons with me on Facebook or you can send me seven seven two seven eight you want to know more about the things that can happen if uganda sends them or you can also find us on facebook instagram twitter and also today we are going to talk about how to make friends with me there is a shortage of pasture for the cattle"

listening to our lectures such as the audio recordings from the radio station or the devine video music library from the school of education and the office of the city council with the office of men or city education office and also in these schools in the form of a prison primary school in the form of a prison primary school in the form of a prison primary school in the form of a prison primary school in the form of a prison in the form of a prison in the form of a prison in the form of a prison in the form of a prison in the form of a prison in the form of a prison in the form of a prison in the form of to help each student to have all the necessary support for his or her education even if it means teaching in the bus station with my friend who is sick of toliromonyute also thank you for the guards I am sick of toliromonyute I am an employee of our school board this fifth term ab share many of the shortcomings that affect learners who have a learning disability that affects the child's speech and also love to be silent what are the causes of disability in children with disabilities instead of listening to the previous lectures and even on the internet at the entrance of the so called dot pray for uganda you can receive these lectures like the audio recorded at my bridge where the music and visual arts are distributed at the divine video and music library to the cathedral of the catholic church of the king demonstration primary school later today and let's discuss this so called disability the child's self-centeredness and self-centeredness affects every child's personality and perceives it as a weakness that affects the way we live our lives and do certain things at all times some of the characteristics that make a child independent talk to themselves and not to others when you look at a child as an example you need to think of a way to help the child to overcome his or her limitations and fight against the limitations that are causing us to say that having a disability is the most common way people see it and it seems to us that if everyone is born with a disability a few people are born with a disability and they can walk the ones with legs are the ones with disabilities as we discussed in our column more than the ones that are important most of all the little ones that show or leave a disabled death that they usually love to play with themselves that we don't even know that a child has to have a lot of memories to talk about memories and a lot of inappropriate and useless words that we like to use to call children with disabilities it is the weakness that makes a child talk to himself and likes to talk to people like that because they are different from other children with disabilities and they show a lot of good examples in the field of education to understand the weaknesses they talk about and to be patient so that we all show good examples when we help children with disabilities although some children show more signs and symptoms than others, let us go over the signs and symptoms so that we have time to understand what to expect from these signs and find out if we talk to each other and if there are not only one or two of these signs and symptoms to some children, it's not the children's house and it's not the children's house and it's not the children's house and it's not the children's house we will start with the topic of self-talk and the topic of silence and the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of the topic of with the disabilities they don't like to be touched, they also don't appreciate it when their favorite parts of the body are touched and they end up on the road, for example, when you hold a dog while talking or walking with them. expressing emotions through facial expressions makes it hard for a person to understand their feelings but it is also very difficult for children with disabilities to express their emotions openly if they don't want to express their emotions openly if they don't know how to express themselves freely if they don't know how to express themselves freely if they don't know how to express themselves freely if they don't know how to express themselves freely to have friends for example they can be your friends because you have what they see and like in you but those friends don't care about the passengers so they don't care about what someone else might want they can be an image but it's important to understand that the most difficult part of expressing the fourth weakness here is holding on to interests and interests and interests or interests that are important to you and they can't take their time to share their experiences it is easy to understand if your child likes to read one thing or if the teacher explains how well the child is doing in the field of education in such a way that there are two main types of learning disabilities but we know that children begin to speak at the age of two years and spend a lot of time learning to speak at five years but it is important that you try to understand what is wrong with them because there is a lot of talk that makes it difficult for a child to communicate with a doctor there are some children with disabilities who are facing problems that they cannot understand and some of the words are hidden if you look at how they are used in that case they represent the opposite of what they are but the children with disabilities are as they are said to be when they say that the court will come and arrest them who will not start searching for the children with disabilities that will start searching for the children with disabilities or the children with disabilities that will it is common to use the same kind of words to say but I repeat today that not all children do this but if this is the case and the right thing to do is to accept the challenge of starting a conversation with a child with a disability it may be like asking a question or starting a conversation with a child with a disability look at the time of the game they rejected some games that require thinking and acting to grow something like you or pretend to be a person who makes people feel good about caring for each other even in the games children with disabilities find it hard to compare themselves to the third and last of the signs of disability that make a child feel good the first is that they always want to show the same behavior as children who can play with the one thing that English people call elimination of there may be other examples of games like loosening and tying a rope not all of us can do this sometimes children with disabilities do it all the time the second time they make a cake and they like to be quiet they find it hard to change the rope which makes it hard for them to communicate with the changing environment one who dies when they find someone wants to leave instead of looking for a new place to live and one of your children is a quiet child who is confused about the time to die when everything is as it is about the disability of children with disabilities that gives a child the ability to talk like other children in the first place depending on the environment to be a loyal person those who are weak and quiet usually speak only the truth when they say what is true and it is very difficult to compare them for example if they see a sacrifice or they will tell the truth about themselves and who did it and if you wear something it is obvious that you do not look good in that dress if you appreciate it because you think that help is also important if you appreciate it and you are always focused and doing things that you love if you like it studying materials that involve the mind and the use of machines that do that more than other things we can also see if you look at them they like to go n draw pictures and draw pictures of things that should be remembered that not all children are gifted and talented not all children have different abilities and other good qualities are built according to the needs in every situation they are involved in believing that they can know everything they need to know about it and I told them art lovers will look for the artist's style of painting differently from the likes and dislikes they have in the past. They are always focused and focused on their interests which gives them a lot of experience to succeed in the long run and the law of averages that they usually follow rather than the law of averages and the law of averages and the law of averages and the law of averages and the law of averages and the law of the disadvantages and the way we talk about children with disabilities is that such issues can cause problems in schools. First of all, if we discuss all the causes of disabilities, I want to emphasize that as parents take care of their children in every way, there are no other children who are cared for and educated well but we can't blame you or those who are caring for the child it is unfair for us not to follow or stand on these issues by allowing traditional healers to get all the help they can from here and from other specialists who work with children with learning disabilities and living with this third normal disability is a common myth that many parents hear in different parts of the world and it is not true and therefore it is advisable for parents to send their children for immunization all I need to know is that all the other factors affecting children's mental and physical health are that they inherited the disorder from their parents or grandparents in the family as well as the effects of the disorder on a child with this disorder it is clear that some of the assumptions about the causes of disability are not found in the body as a whole and that we should all praise children based on these characteristics, including understanding their needs and addressing the various challenges that parents, teachers, and the community can address interaction with children and peers in the school is perceived to be vulnerable in the first place because of the difficulty of forcing a child with this disability to work hard but more so if you ask them about their needs and the free time they have to play and remember that children who prefer to be alone or have friends for example can go through the mindset of watching movies and TV instead of forcing them to play football with their peers where they are forced to playing with friends is not a good way to communicate with other children, including teachers, and it will help the disabled child to get to know and understand how to avoid problems with other children, such as how to provide for himself and his family without listening to them during games or using inappropriate language that a child has a disability and as a teacher you can explain to the students how you can be involved and if you are a parent or a teacher you can make sure that the child has a disability if you look at everything in the school as it is necessary to use a sleep schedule for the family and the classroom and make sure that the house and the classroom are in the same place it will also make them remember that children who don't like the things that happen in the classroom should be able to play outside the classroom if you want to change it, you need to talk to them about it. They are like playing in the backyard or in the backyard if you have a safe place to hide in the backyard if you have a safe place to hide in the backyard if you have a safe place to hide in the backyard if you have your child changes the world around them when you know that something big is going to happen so he tries not to use his hidden language or words like village when you talk to him they may understand differently from what you are thinking about examples of a disabled child who will start looking for a fire or a flood of locusts when dealing with situations like hot weather and cold weather, it is very difficult for a child with a disability to understand their abilities and if you want to help children with disabilities to develop their social skills, it means that they cannot learn things like how to interact with people in a playful way guessing whether someone is happy or upset with them can reveal and ask the child what it means or you can tell them how happy they are with their eyes or body and control them and u and their friends or the bush often give them time to try out their weaknesses thanks to our fifth edition of the children's training where we discussed in detail the characteristics or signs of the disabilities that make the child vulnerable all the ways we can help children with talk about the challenges faced by people at home and at school and thank you for listening to our fifth children's lectures you can also contact us on Facebook or send us questions seven, six, three, seven, eight you want to know more about the information you can find on our website or follow us on Facebook and Twitter"
