Children no longer have friends with their parents because of the things their parents do. This is the main cause of infertility among children.

Uganda's economy has actually slowed down, because that child has many expectations from their childhood that they cannot meet. When they get advice during the holidays, they say, ""Actually, what they gave me was a mobile phone. "" Now, things have become too much for Ugandans here, the needs of a child cannot be met and parents too can see themselves. They earn slowly, they cannot provide for the child's needs. As a result, the daughter falls in love with her son, but fails to give him the money. And remember, unfortunately, they have not yet understood the words of having a family, but if you do, they will go straight to getting pregnant. Actually, I have been asking stakeholders whether the government has changed its stance. We feel sorry for the children and we are concerned about their welfare. As a parent, you have to take care of your mother, take care of the little ones. Now, let them sort this out when it's missing, either for themselves or the board. You can even come up with ideas to help us. Indeed, they have turned the tide against us.",The speaker expresses concern about young people in Uganda facing challenges related to poverty and limited resources. They call for changes in the system to address these issues and ensure that children are supported and cared for adequately. This is a personal plea for action from those involved or the government to prioritize the welfare of young individuals in need.,"A concern is raised regarding young girls becoming pregnant in Uganda due to economic challenges and unmet childhood expectations. Stakeholders question if the government has addressed this issue, expressing worry over children's well-being. As a parent, it is important to prioritize taking care of one's mother and protecting the younger generation. Suggestions for improving the situation are encouraged."

It could have been a product of the children's religious upbringing. If every child is religious in the world, what does it help them to be doing? That is, they avoid such acts but then, but sometimes in our country here, as you can see many cultures have come back and people we would consider as leaders. They saw it and practiced it.","The names David and Eve are common among religious families in this community, leading to a moral code that discourages certain behaviors.

It has also made it a criminal offence to impregnate a child under the age of eighteen. But if you tell us that you are guilty of indiscipline, the opposition should introduce a law that carries a penalty of twenty years in jail for getting pregnant with a premature baby. It is a turn-around.","The government should establish policies to educate individuals about the dangers of early pregnancies and implement strict laws that hold offenders accountable for crimes committed. However, some may argue against such measures due to concerns about infringing on personal freedom or violating cultural norms.",The speaker proposes introducing laws to educate individuals on the risks of early pregnancy and penalize those who engage in irresponsible behavior by making it a crime to impregnate a minor. They suggest adding a severe punishment of 20 years in prison for conceiving a premature infant as a deterrent measure.
