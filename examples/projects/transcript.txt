Welcome to our twenty-ninth episode of Every Child Can Land. My name is Lara Gladesi, and I am the lead runner at Backup Uganda. Today, we are very happy. Once again to meet our new guest. Who is going to tell us her name, where she is from, and what she does for a living? You must welcome, I'm actually from America. Originally, I've been in Uganda for eleven years now, so in Gulu, I'm pretty much in Gulu at this point. I have a masters on public health. And my husband and I work here in Gulu, running a ministry doing house calls called house to house following Jesus. And I'm also a mother of two boys, one is nine years old and the other is aging six. So happy to be. Here than very much. I believe you know a little bit of actually. Now, for eleven years, it's quite a long time being in gold. Interesting. Thank you so much, at least she knows a nominee. Thanks so much, I know our listeners will be very interesting to hear the whole story. I know before we met. Before we did this recording, we had a conversation about your child having an autism. Would you let us know about being a parent to a child with both autism? And how and when did you know in the first place that you have a child with both? Autism and I didn't notice at first. Like my child, my nine-year-old has autism in eight, and at first we didn't really notice because developed mentally. He was hitting all of his milestones, so he was when baby started to crawl. He was within the range of starting to crawl when. Babies are starting to walk. He's starting to walk when they are toileting independently. He was toileting independently, so there wasn't anything major happening. We had a moment when we were like, \"Is he okay?\" But we had just gone to America for the first time after having him here. We went to America. He heard all those American accents and then we came back and then he got very quiet, like he had been starting to make those like baba baby sounds. And then he got to Uganda and started hearing a choli again, and then we thought maybe. It was like he was just listening. He was just trying to understand, like some things shifted and how everyone is speaking and there is a second language. But then, after a couple of months, he just started speaking in full sentences and speaking a truly and English so is. Like okay, he was just learning his second language, so we didn't think anything of it until twenty twenty. Really, so up until then, you know he's great, he's really sweet. He was a little bit we would call quirky in America, where he's just like that sometimes. Doing things a little different when he would play with friends. It would be sometimes he would just observe friends playing instead of actually actively playing with them. You know, and so he is like, \"I played with friends, and I'm thinking, I don't know that that counted, but you.\" Think you had a good time, so okay. It's okay, and so we didn't really think too much of it until two thousand twenty, which was a tough year for everyone because of the pandemic. And we were in Uganda, going through lockdowns just like everyone else and not leaving. Our compounds staying at home and he missed seeing his friends. You know, all of our social lives have all gone away and we are all with ourselves. And so, towards the end of twenty-twenty, my normally very chady,very like, lots of story-telling. Big imagination child stopped really speaking. He would share if he had a like a need. So, if he needed to, if he was hungry or if he was tired, he would say, \"Mom, I am hungry, Mom, I want something to eat. I am tired.\" But instead of telling us these interesting stories, he brought us together. Into his world you know. With his words, he just stopped speaking, and that was our first real signs of like some things wrong. People don't just stop talking, you know. That's not normally what's going on, and where is our sign? Like we in, we missed him and we missed. Our normal conversations and our life that we had grown used to with him and so on. And he had also replaced those times of talking and sharing with us with what we now know to be stepping back where he is. Self-soothing by doing some activity over and over. And over again, so for him. It was running across the room, slamming against a wall, and then coming back and then doing it again. And he wasn't hurting himself, he wasn't harming himself. But it was just all the time, and it was the only thing that apparently was keeping him. He was calm. We didn't know that we were screaming out because it was so different than what we ever experienced before. So that's when we knew, and so that happened for about three months. And then when the lockdowns lifted, we found out that children couldn't get COVID, which was very difficult. Exciting and so he started meeting his friends again and starting to visit them. And he went back to his normal self, he got a little bit of his normal life. The stress lowered and he went back to being his normal self, and so on. But that was so strange. And it happened for three months. That we knew we needed to find some answers, so we were already planning to go back to America. So we went back to America and sought out a diagnosis, and then we found that he had autism and so on. Let's see how. We did it. It sounds a very long story, but as a parent, it is also a challenging moment where you're in a mix of two disorders - autism and autism. But also, I want to understand what I know. You already said you went to America and you did a diagnosis and... They found out that he had autism. But I want you to help listeners out there to understand what are some of the signs one can see in children with both conditions. It's confusing because when I was on my own during that period of silence with my child, I... Researching am looking on the internet and there are the list for autism. He would check some of those boxes and the list for autism. He would check some of those boxes but he didn't check enough of either box for me to be like, \"Oh, I know what is.\" Happening is like I don't know what's happening. Why, why is it both or nothing? I don't know you now, so we got that diagnosis and now I can see why. It's because sometimes autism and ADD hide each other when they're both in one person's brain. They don't. Look like maybe a typical artistic person or a typical not look, but have the behaviors of a typical one or the other. Because they are mixed, but I have there are things that do crossover between both. And if you think about like two circles, there is the artistic circle. And there is the circle and these symptoms of both of those diagnoses. There is a section where those two circles are overlapping. There's a cent if you have those two rings overlapping, there is an intersection. Thank you, and so in that intersection is a lot that it is. Actually, a very large intersection between the two so focus is one of those things where they are both and I have notes so I don't get lost. But both can struggle with focus, in maintaining focus or becoming hyper focused. So it's instead of kind of in the middle. Of course I have my focus on this and then I am going over here, especially with preferred tasks. So something that an artistic or aged person loves to do, they will stay completely focused. They have no attention for anything outside of that world because they are working so hard. And then going to something that is not preferred, something that you don't like to do. It is very difficult to maintain the focus to be able to complete that task. To do that, and that is with both art and impulsivity. Can be very similar as well, so can an addiction. The brain can be very impulsive. It can say things or do things without really thinking. It goes so fast from the brain to the body or the mouth that it just comes out. Autism can happen, particularly when an artistic person is stressed. So when they are very stressed, they Have that same impulse to just fix it. Just do something and then the impulsivity and artistic people can go down when they are less stressed. But it just depends in my child's brain. It's both so impulsivity is something we deal with all the time. Transitions can be Very the same in both A and A. Because transitions are hard, especially if you're going from something you love to do to something you just have to do right. So, getting my kids to brush their teeth is not their favorite thing to do - they would rather play. You know, so if I am getting them to go from playing to brushing their teeth, it can be a big struggle, and for both an autistic and brain just to get moving into that thing, even if you know you want to do it or you know you have. To and you know you're supposed to. It is a real big struggle just to transition into that routine. Are one of those things that I feel like are mostly the opposite? But kind of not so. People tend to struggle with keeping a routine, to struggle with keeping a. Habit and like oh, I just do this. I don't think about it, I am always just doing this habit. But at the same time, I have seen a lot of it. Adults who have to have a routine have to have a system in place so that they Can get their life completed? Get those tasks completed and artistic people also love routines because it gives them a sense of control of a very chaotic world. There is a lot going on, and so those routines can really help them to feel calmer, so my child with both. He loves to have routines and then gets frustrated when he can't maintain the routine. Or, especially if other people can't maintain the routine that he has set for them. So, but he finds it valuable which I get. Social situations are another one, so social difficulties are a criteria for Diagnosis for artistic people because they struggle so much with social dynamics, because communicating, understanding the rules of society, and how people talk. There often noticed to be like, \"Why did you miss that? Why did you miss this social cue?\" She said, \"Why didn't you respond in this way?\" Way you know, like you were somewhere else, but eight people can do the same thing. Because again, the brain and the mouth are just going, they might say things and like, \"I know, I wasn't supposed to say that, I have also made a mess of this social.\" situation so there is a lot of overlap. Still, it looks a little different sometimes, but when it's all in one brain, it can look very similar. And then the last one I think I have on my list is sensory sensitivities, which is such a big one in our own. House, but I think it can be in a lot of places. So when you have issues with senses, and they can be either hyper or hyperactive, so like you really, really notice the bright light. You really, really notice the itchiness on your clothing, you can see all those. Things like you're noticing all those things or you barely notice other things, so we know that the normal five senses are what the sight, taste, touch, smell, sound. There are three more vestibular ones, so I call this the like the motion sickness one because if you're on a bus. The vestibular system is in charge of telling you where your body is in space and when you are moving very fast. Like if you are taking a bus somewhere and you get motion sickness, your vestibular system is like, \"Why are we moving so fast? Your sitting still, you.\" Must be poisoned. Let's throw up and get the poison out, but that's something where like your body is just having a hard time knowing where it is in space, so your coordinated movement and artistic people can be clumsy. Sometimes they just fall for no reason or Like trying to walk through an open door and they still bang on the side of the door. They just missed that opening because they don't know where their body is in space. Sorry with being clumsy and then also balance as well and then force so like how hard. You touch something or how softly you touch something is something that the perceptions should tell you. But sometimes, those signals are not coming from the brain to the body or the brain to the brain, and the way that they would for other people who don't have these. Diagnosis then. The last one is interception, so what is your body feeling? So when you know you need to go, shut up and your bodies like giving your warning. Like you need to use the toilet, you need to go. It's time to prepare yourself to go, get up and go. To the toilet sometimes. Those signals don't always come. Either they come at the last minute or they come when they are very high. You know, your body's screaming, go to the toilet when you finally get up and go. That can happen with both of you as well, so giving. Those inside signals, and that is also with how you're emotionally feeling and how you're experiencing empathy. So, understanding how someone else is feeling sometimes you can be super aware or not very much at all. So, I'm sorry, this list is so long - they're all things that my. Child experiences and the levels are different. It depends on the day, it can depend on other things, but I think we have all struggled with those things. Like, this music is just too loud for me. These clothes just don't feel right today, they are itchy, they are tight. And uncomfortable it's like that. But even more, sometimes you know in an artistic and spiritual sense. This is interesting and I know whatever. My guest has been explaining some of the things that we really experience as human beings or as people who don't have these conditions. But trust me, For a child or for some one, having this condition is way more often than what we experience as people who do not have these conditions. But I am very much amazed by the message we are getting. I know this is a lot of content, but please, I love the That fact is bringing it out clearly. And another interesting thing that I really want to find out from my guest is, how have you been able to support your child? It really feels like it's a lot, having a child with disability and then the same time having a child. Who has autism? I want our listeners to know that these are two different conditions. Autism is to do with someone, not socializing. You are to yourself, and then is the opposite. You are hyper, you want to do this after something comes up. You can't maintain your impulse, something pops up. In your mind you say it now. Those are two different things, but our guest has a child with both. So, someone should rather start imagining how is she managing with this child? So, I want her to also tell us how have you been able to really support her? Child than so. Like I said, there are so many things that are similar with those two diagnoses. But I think the most important thing that we did was as soon as we did find out that he was artistic and was talking with him because even though he was young. He was five years old when we got his diagnosis. So, you know, like he's a child, he doesn't understand anything. No, he knew he could know that something was a little bit different about himself, and he could. Now, you can't figure out why what I feel like I am. Doing everything the same as everyone else. But I don't and like people looking at me weird. You know, he is with his classmates and it's just not going the way that he thinks it should go, and it was really confusing to him, so we shared with him about it. His diagnosis and explained that his brain is different than other people's, which can be really amazing and give him so many gifts in the world. But also, it can be challenging because he doesn't think in the same pattern that a lot of other people do around him, so. Was one of the biggest things to support him? I just continue to talk with him when he feels frustrated or confused about what he is experiencing in the world. So, we therapy is amazing, so we had opportunities to connect with occupational therapists. I know that several people end up Up working with speech therapists when they have trouble with speaking and we almost did. They were able to address specific things that would help him to gain more abilities or to be able to continue to progress in his independence as he grows up. So we are constantly doing. Do those things. It is a lot of work, but at the same time, it is very worth it. You can see the growth that he has had. Its slow growth, but you can see it over the years, and then understanding his I spent a lot of time thinking about. How to support him? If there is a skill that I want him to learn, like bathing himself, right? This was much younger, but he struggled with it. Like, there's actually a lot of tasks in bathing yourself. It's like getting the solution, getting the spin, turning on the water turning. Off the water, drying yourself off. How do you bathe without getting soap in your eyes? And you, you know, all of these things we don't think about? It was like autumn, take a bath, you are fine. Get clean, but I needed more support, so something that I do a. Lot is figured out. Okay, this is too far for you. This is your edge of competency, of understanding and knowing how to do something. Taking a bath when he was five was too far, like doing that independently without my help. It was too far for him to really get. So I kept and backing up until I could break down the steps. Like, your job right now is to get yourself undressed. We're going to just work on that skill and then the next job is like getting the water temperature where you need it to be okay. Next job you know. Like, once you become skilled with something, then that's no longer a challenge for him. It doesn't feel like chaos, and then we can add on, but it's a little bit at a time. Instead of just going take a bath, figure out how to spend a lot of time together. Time doing that to provide those supports and breaking skills down into something that feels manageable and something that he can do peacefully. Peace by peace that we work on, and then the last thing that I do is just letting him be him. You know, artistic people are known, often. For their stammering or walking in an interesting way on their tip toes. Things like that, and it's not harming anyone. It's a way that they keep themselves calm, right? It's a way to experience joy, and I found out very quickly. I followed a lot of artistic. Adults on the internet thank you. Adults on the internet thank you for sharing these experiences. It was when they were able and allowed to be themselves, when it wasn't harming anyone and it wasn't harming themselves, and they were just able to spin for as long as they wanted or walked. On their toes without anyone complaining. Then they felt more themselves, and then they felt more free, and they felt more control of themselves. Which I love. I want my child to be independent and know that he is a valuable person, just as he is. I would just like to. To pick up from your last point of allowing a child with autism to be themselves. Now, a lot of our parents out there want their children to behave like any other child. Or I want you to be sharp. I want you to do things faster, faster, like the other sibling. Does it matter with a child who is artistic? I have always told parents, especially the parents we work with. The schools we work with, that sometimes you will get a child who is very slow and they are happy the way they do their things. They are happy the way they are. Are to themselves and this is something that as a parent you like. Now go and play with your friends, you're doing it wrong. Go and sit somewhere with your other children or other siblings, but trust me for someone with autism. That is the atmosphere they want that is. The environment they want and then also wanted to share about a gentleman. You can go on Google, call him Stephen, he will share. This is a gentleman who is very talented. There is one of the characteristics of children who are artistic that when they love something, they love it. To their best, so this is a gentleman. If you go Google about him, you're going to see that he loves drawing and not that every child or everyone who is artistic draws its different. It varies from one person to another, and that's why we call it a Spectrum because there are people who have a mild version. They are those that have severe that it is a little bit hard for them to grasp things. But one of the key things with artistic people is that they are very talented when they love something they love it to. Their best now. I also want you to help us understand. I know this is something that is very common with us here, that people have a lot of misconceptions or misses about certain disabilities or certain disorders that get a view or did you or people around you have. Misconceptions about your child having these conditions. Forgive me if I sound like crying. I always cry about this because it's a tough topic to discuss. So when I first got my child's diagnosis, especially autism, even in America, this is a very similar experience. The number of people who told me They were so sorry for me. Like I lost a loved one is too high to count when I shared his diagnosis. That they would often say, \"I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry for this difficulty that you're going through.\" Like I had a sick, sick family member in the... Hospital or something. But I didn't - I had the same child that I had for the last five years. I just now knew why he was quirky and you know why he was different. But I think that was because they had this conception that my child with autism was broken somehow. And it was frustrating. It was really frustrating and hard, and I got so confused because it's like everyone's telling me I should feel sad right now, so I don't. But I don't know, why do you know what's going on? And finally, now I'm a Christian, so I'm going to. Have a Christian perspective on this. Praying about it, I realized that God made my child artistic. He is artistic, that's how he was born, and that's how he has always been, and that's how he sees the world. And the beautiful thing is, he is that artistic and adds people. Get to see the world in a way that the rest of us don't. We don't get the way that they view it, and then they have an opportunity. If we let them to bring their viewpoints and perspectives into the conversation, however, the thing that I do grieve for is me. I feel sad about is that we live in a broken world that is not made for people who are outsiders. It is not developed in a way that is always including people who are on the fringes. It pushes people out of the fringes of society, and that's the Part that I do get sad about and I do get frustrated with. That's the hard part about having an artistic child. It's not him, it's that the world is not made for him, and it's constantly telling him that he doesn't belong in it, and we have to fight. Constantly to bring him back in. But also, that was Jesus' ministry - he always included outsiders. He made so many people angry for including outsiders. He would always be a place to bring people in, and so that's what I feel for parents out there who are struggling with that same. A situation where your child is behaving so differently from the rest. It's so important to know that they are uniquely themselves, and we have an opportunity as parents to bring them into society and to train, educate, and help other people around us to know that they are. Diversity is good. It brings new perspectives. That is why we have so many cultures in the world, and if we can learn to share and understand and appreciate someone else's culture, it's the same with these artistic and social brains. This is very interesting and touching here, the same. Time about what people think out there. And this is why we are here. This is why we are talking about this. This is why a backup is making sure that the community gets to know about this cause. Sometimes, it is also challenging that our parents in the communities. Do not understand what is this autism? These people are talking about what is this autism? They are used to someone using a wheelchair, that one is using a wheelchair. Something happened with the limbs, the one he got a nodding condition and all that. But today, we are talking. What is this about autism? What is this about autism? It sounds new, they may not know what are the characteristics, and this is why we hear this. This is why we are talking about this, that these people are human beings like us, and I want to agree with some that we are. The ones who are disabling them are us. We are the ones who are throwing them away. We don't want them to participate in all the other activities. And mind you, they are equally the same as those that we think are normal. They can do absolutely everything that we do and That is the beauty of it. A child with autism is bright, absolutely very bright, but the way they do their things is like things that we need to understand. They might do it slowly, they might need patience, or those are some of the things that as a parent out. There as a teacher has an advocate. You need to know and sell it out there, tell the community, tell the parents out there that one you need to first accept these children. Acceptance will open doors for us to accept these children in all aspects of life, so I Am really very happy that we are having in this conversation. And a complicated one, because imagine a child having both and someone's had one. But I just love the way a parent is bringing it out, and today for me, I am very pleased because this is not an assumption. We are talking about real things. She has a child who has both this condition, and I hope by the end of this, it's going to be okay for everyone to work up and start doing sensitization about these conditions. And I also want to understand what you can tell me. Parents having children struggling with such conditions. I know you are bringing it up in your conversation, but you could still hint at one or two major areas where you think parents having these children can do better. No matter what age or child it is, I would say it's never too late. Late to start supporting them. It's never too late, and even if you feel like maybe you failed in the past or you did it wrong, somehow in your own way. I stopped them from doing that thing, and now I'm thinking about it again. It's never too late. To change and your child will appreciate that. So, you always have an opportunity to grow. As a parent, I have grown a lot in the last few years and to learn how to support them better. It's never too late, and then another thing that again I have. A unique perspective in that I am an American living in Uganda. And I realized at some point after getting my child's diagnosis and hearing from other artistic and cultural people that artistic and cultural people are a lot like another culture. They are their own culture they might understand. Each other better. Two artists from totally different backgrounds might understand each other better than they would. The rest of society, who have no artistic fans, realize that it is like they were born with their own unique culture. So, they might be a choir, but they are also artistic. And they have two cultures in their head that they are working with. And when I, as an American, showed up in Uganda, I was very lost. I didn't know, like I don't have autism. But I don't know anything about culture and about what was normal and how. To greet people on the street not even language, but just how to behave. How you shake hands in my doing it right and everything that I did, especially in the beginning. I was learning when trying it. I was trying out like these rules of society to try to understand. How many people are Ugandan people? I worked so that I could blend in and look kind of normal, and nobody thought I was too weird. Even though I definitely stick out, but that could understand culture. Artistic people are born into that same situation - they are born not understanding the rules of The society that they have been dropped into, even if it is the one that is technically theirs, but they are always artistic and so they are always having to perceive the world around them from that learning experience. And that's exhausting when I first came here, I had to. To sleep so much because my brain was on overload trying to understand society. How to do anything because nothing was normal to me, so I would ask other parents to be sensitive to your child. Give them some understanding, some grace, some empathy in knowing that they are struggling with. The day to day that you don't even think about. You don't even consider you just do your day, and they are having to think through all of the patterns, all of the conversations, and prepare themselves so that they look normal or they match what is happening around them. So when they mess it up or they don't behave in that way, I ask that you give them that grace. That understanding like you would, and so many gracious people were to me as a foreigner who didn't know anything. And many people were so kind and I so. Appreciate it. But understand that your child, whose artistic side it is, is also having those struggles. So give them that kind of grace you would give someone who is not from your culture. This brings me to repeat what I have always told parents, that home is the first school, just like you. She said get to know your child better. Actually, you know your child better than a teacher because you are the one to take your child to school and tell the teacher that this is how I give birth to this child. She shows these signs when she does this. Things and all that cause. If you don't, then it's going to be a hard thing for a teacher to start understanding. And there are the teachers who will keep sending this child away from classroom because they don't understand. So, please, just like I said, let's take time to. Understand who our children are and then let's not force them. I have a sibling who is had you take forever to explain to him, but we have also gotten on to understand that there is something wrong. Your child may not be the same at any other child trust. Me you might have four children and two might be very bright, very brilliant rather than one. The other two might be struggling, so don't assume that the other two should be as bright as the other two. So let's take time to understand our children and also their behaviors then. I also wanted to find out from my guest, Caroline, if you ever heard about inclusive education. Because our discussion is all surrounding inclusive education, we are looking at including those children with all these conditions we are talking about. We are just talking about autism today, but there are others. Many more other conditions that we have not talked about. So, I wanted our guests to explain about something about inclusive education. If you have ever heard about it, thank you from America. They have inclusive education programs, the ones of when I was growing up called Special Education Programs. Had special teachers. There were moments in our day where the children that were in special education would merge with the ones who weren't, and then they would go away. And then that was my understanding - something is happening here, and now I know so much more than I did. I did so. I had some awareness and some people working into that. But I will say that I am learning so much more now that it is a part of my life, and I have taken it on so much more because it is something that is personal to me. Than you very much just to a on what colonel said. How do we look at inclusive education? Just from the word inclusive, is regardless of any one's race, tribe, culture, religion, mention they are all part of? Let's a system that has been put up, let's look at education they are to. Be included. We are trying to fight against units. You go in schools and you get a separate unit created for children with disabilities. We are fighting that they should be included in one classroom and even taught as one class. Now, a lot of times when you go, To different schools, their practicing exclusion is their practicing integration. They are practicing segregation, and I mean that is not inclusion. We are looking at involving every child, we have not mentioned disabilities here, but every child, regardless of what they are going through, to be in one class and that. Is that why today we are having this conversation? If you have a child who is artistic, if you have a child who is hyper, if you have a child who keeps to herself or keeps to himself, what are you going to do? Are you going to build a room? For them, are you going to create a classroom? For them, learn the skills of how you can handle the different categories of learners. They are even students or children who may not have these conditions, but they portray one or two of characteristics and as a teacher, you. We need to know how to handle that. And that is why we are saying inclusion is paramount. Inclusion is the key to all that we are doing. Similarly, to your homes, you don't segregate your children. If you are doing that, then you should change as a parent out there. Exactly so. The thing is really interesting is, now I know that like our classrooms when I was a child didn't have to be segregated. It didn't have to be, and when we had the moments, we were all in the same classroom together. I benefited from the People who were in the special education classes benefited from them. I learned more, I understood more, and became a better person because of it. So, it's not just benefiting the child who might have a disability, it's benefiting the children who don't and makes them better. Better citizens of the world, better people in the community. From that inclusion, so I'm all for it or worse. Proud that I know someone out there is wondering, \"Are we talking about your child, your child, has your child been able to join school?\" I know it's a Question that is running in people's minds. Could you tell us if your child has been able to go to school and how easy it has been for either the teacher who is teaching him or your home schooling? How has it been easy and now these are skills? That a teacher out there wants to grasp how I handle a child in classroom. We don't have classroom experience. I am a homeschooling parent, we did try school, and it was a struggle. I think because those teachers didn't know how to include him in a That way was really benefiting everyone. But I have had it for several years now. The same time I got my child's diagnosis in twenty-one, twenty-one was also when we were starting school. So, I have been the teacher and the mom for quite some time now, so yet I have. Things that have worked in my home to help my child learn. Children both learn that have really worked, and I hope that teachers out there can take what works and adapt it to a larger classroom setting. So, transitions? I know that we talked about this earlier that transitions can. Be a struggle and so something that I do to help both of my children transition from their playtime or something that's really easy for them into something that's more into like okay, were getting into serious learning. Now is when I give them a transition activity so that I will. They often do like maizes or puzzles or something. It gets their brain working, but it feels like a game. So if you have that game learning that you want to do with your classroom, we're going to start with the game or we're going to go from play time into this more. Seriously, I would encourage everyone to find something that can transition them out of full play and into that serious learning. There's kind of a middle way, so I would suggest that it works wonders for my kids to instead of them running around outside, then I am getting them. into something that they like. But now they are seated and then they are working and then we move forward. From there, there is something that I do and I get the benefit of doing it. As a home school, I am allowing my children to choose the order of their activities so. I was thinking about this for classrooms. And if you have stations of learning, that might be a place where you're all learning about something and you're going to go from station to station, allowing those kids to choose which station they start at. So, instead of saying you're Starting here, you're starting there. Like, these are all the stations. Choose the one you can if there's too many kids. I'm going to have to divide you up, but there is an ability for them to have that sense of self, that sense of choice, and that they. Are not always being told what to do. And honestly, this probably benefits all people, not just people. I don't want to be told what to do all the time. I didn't when I was a kid, so I think they would all benefit from if you can provide choice. Do it. I think it really benefits my kids and then taking breaks. Taking breaks feels like I get into this a lot. It's like we have so much to do, I don't want to take a break. It will be so hard to get them back to what they used to be. Are you doing that? I have too much work to complete. My experience is that for both of my children, after they take a break even a short one of five minutes, they are so much more focused. They are so much more able to learn, their bodies are ready, their minds. Are you ready? Just because I took five minutes that I timed, so we didn't lose track. To move around, to wiggle up, to stand up to whatever it is, so that they felt like they could regain their focus. Because, especially when there and I are only teaching nine and six. Age but maintaining focus for a long time can be hard for all people, and so it's really difficult when your little body just has to go. So allowing them the time in the space to do that really helps, and I use visuals whenever I can so any. Time that I can put the order of what we are doing in picture form on the board so my kids know we're going to do this activity. Then we're going to do this, we're doing math, then we're doing reading, then we're doing punic, then we. Are we going to play and then we are going to do lunch and then this we are going to do? I can as much as possible give them those words. Are they fine, but if your children aren't reading yet? Well, sometimes everyone just likes pictures if you can have a. Picture up on the board to say this is that activity we are going to do. This is so great if you're good at drawing excellent. Maybe one of your children is a great drawer. Have them dry, but then, like everyone knows what is coming, and they can mentally. Prepare themselves to work with you. to go from one activity to the next, and so that really helps. And then also giving timers for things like even those breaks. Say we have five minutes we were going to do this, go outside and you have one minute left and one. One minute we are coming back and the one minute is finished. We are coming in now, all of those things help the child transition their brain from one activity to the next. They are not surprised, they are not frustrated, because you've told them and they're like, \"I understand what I'm doing.\" This you know and it really helps. And then, for those who have a really hard time with focus, I found that physically touching is just a gentle touch to an addictive brain, in particular where they are focused on something or you're not sure if they are hearing you. I know it's easy to get frustrated and just keep shouting louder. But it actually works so much better if you go and physically touch them like he's you, hearing me. This is the instruction, and they will receive the instruction better because of that physical, gentle touch just a little. Touch on their arm or on their hand like this is happening. Now are you hearing my instructions and with that, obedience is something that I know that we all struggle with? Well, because we do want our classrooms, our lives, to not be so chaotic with the children. Are not running it. The parents and the teachers are running it, and so the thing that I have found for helping my child be more obedient is to behave in a way that we can both get along with when they are having a hard day. Especially is to state What is happening? So state the problem because sometimes they don't know what the problem is. So, like I said that we are going to move to math and you haven't gotten your work book out. I've stated the problem and then saying, \"Do you need help getting? Your mouth book out or you can do it on your own. There is some choice in how to do it. Maybe they've lost their mouth book, they don't want to tell you that they've lost it. Maybe they don't know where that is, but you're giving them choices and You're starting that conversation. I have had moments where I am leading a group of very young kids in a small lesson, and they are busy playing. And I am like, \"Lessons starting and I'm just repeating myself, lessons starting, they're all ignoring me, and instead of shouting, I have just Go over, come down to where they were in. Saying, \"I've asked you to come over, are you able to do that?\" And every one of them, like, \"Boom, boom, boom, I just came over and it was quieter.\" It was orderly, no one's angry. It took me less time. And less frustration than if I had just kept shouting until something happened. So that is something that really helped me with both of my children, to really get them to work with me on doing something and we are learning together. We're going as one, okay? Thank you so much! Much you have met me. Keep smiling, I have changed my sitting position to see you and just understand. And I realized that teachers who are listening to this will understand because a lot of times, these are the things we communicate to them, and I kept noting down a few. Of the things that for me it's too doubtful for me and I am like this is amazing. It is the same thing that we have been telling teachers and in just likeolina explained, having breaks having ice breakers in each and every lesson. Your teaching is very important. For example, kids are from breakfast or they are from lunch. Either they are full or the excited from running around on all that. The inter classroom boom, we are going to learn about sanitation for example. Trust me, even someone who doesn't have any condition will feel it. Man, let us fast, rest, let my brain fast, set all so. I just love the point that Cola said that have some brains. Let them start singing as they are coming down. They are trying to settle themselves, trying to settle their brains down, and then you can. Start your lesson and then it. Something that also stood out for me was asking them to make choices. Now, the one thing I have always told people or I tell parents who are close to home is, \"When you're beating a child, let the child know why you're beating him.\" Or here you enter. You get a cane and lie down like the child is going to cry for two hours because he forgot everything. You've bitten me for nothing, so it's very important. Do you know why I am caning you? Yes, why am I caning you, okay? Am caning you because you fail to do a cd. Such a child will not cry for one hour because he or she knows that they have caned me for something they have done wrong. I am not saying caning is good. I am just giving an example to them. Understand why you want this to be done or why you are doing it. I remember in our conversation some time back with Caroline, she talked about explaining to her children, \"But why, mummy? Why, and we have these children in our classrooms? We have these children in our homes, where the child lives.\" And you, as a parent, you like them. But you kid, actually, they shall lend you so. Most of the time, we need to have the reasons, and these kids are very brilliant when they ask, \"But why am I going to town to buy?\" But why, even after telling? Tell them to buy food for dinner. But why so? They really want to understand, and that's how their brains function. Tell them the reason, don't leave them hanging, and then also give them instructions. At a time when you come to a class and you tell a child to pick out. Your math book get this text book open. Page twenty man for a child with autism, even a child with is already lost. Its a lot of instructions, can you tell them one instruction at a time? Get your math book, have you all opened your math book or gotten your. Mass books out. Yes, teacher, go to page ten. Are we all on page ten? Teacher, yes, teacher, no, teacher. Yes, you follow, you go to the ones who are lost, open up together with them. Trust me, the one thing I have seen with schools is that these are Teachers that will be loved because they do things that kids want. And this is what we call a learner-centered way of teaching. You're not doing a teacher way of teaching, a teacher way of teaching is you do your things and the kids have to follow by force, but... A leaned-on way of teaching is when you communicate to them, you do things that work for them. Of course, not pushing you away from your lesson plan, but at least your communicating to them and them, also aligning with what you have prepared for them and then giving them time to trust. Meanwhile, this is also the hardest thing with adults. We do a lot of training with teachers, and when we give them activities in the cost of training, just go through activities and then don't tell them the minutes left they are going to start having conversation. Some of them are going. To start laughing and then they start doing their own things. But should you give them a time limit? Two minutes left, someone is already quacking and picking the pen, exactly picking the paper. Let me do this so you realize that it doesn't only work for children with these. conditions but it also works for all of us. So a lot of these strategies not only help children with disabilities, but also work for all of us. It's actually an added value to even some one who doesn't have any disability. It makes them even understand. You the more so. These are some of the things that you can do, teachers out there. I know the teachers that have already got into our trainings. Please, just do this. You are going to put a smile on someone's face, you are going to put a smile on. This artistic child's face. They will look for you, they will want that particular school. I know the parents, they know that my child doesn't want to be changed. I want this school, I want this teacher. Actually, they call out the names of the teachers they love, and some teachers are. Like, but why does this child love teacher class but not teacher class? Well, there is a reason why I ask them. I actually ask them, \"Why don't you be mad that this teacher has something unique? Of course they have something unique, and the uniqueness is they understand the student they take time to learn.\" They take time to accept them the way they are and also give them the room to share. Ask them out, did you understand what I taught you? Let your children be free with you, their teachers. When kids see them, when children see them, they keep quiet they are. Not free because one you know doesn't talk to them. You don't understand them. I have met kids who tell me that teacher when I put out my hand, the teacher doesn't pick me. It looks simple and something useless, but to a child, it hurts them, so let's try. To understand who our children are in classrooms. Most of the time, we say, \"You don't teach a class, you teach an individual lane.\" So, it also comes with understanding who your children are. This one is a first lane, this one is a slow lane, this one will understand after. Have you repeated three times? When you know those categories of children in your class, then even when you are teaching and explaining a concept, you will have gladly put in the back of your mind that she is a slolan. Now, those are words we don't like using, but you will know that she is. Is struggling. She understands after repeating and then you will understand that Caroline is someone who is very fast in understanding, so you also know how to treat her in classroom. So, this was just something that I wanted to add on top of what my guests explained to me. Do not know if you have your last message. Yes, I am grateful for this time. Thank you for the opportunity to share my story. This is the first time I have publicly shared my story in any way. I really realized in preparing for this how much I Had to say on it. I hope that parents and teachers out there can be encouraged by what I have shared and know that your child can be included. That you, as the parent in particular, have the opportunity to bring them in to the conversation. Bring your child in. And bring them in to those spaces in your lives and to support them so that they can do that and help them to make their way. As teachers, you are doing a great job. You are doing amazing work and everything that goes into teaching. I love it! And I am so into it. And I hope the teachers can hear how they can make a space that doesn't just benefit those disabled children, but it benefits everyone. We all have difficulties that we struggle with. Even if we don't have these conditions, we can all benefit. From these things that we are providing for artistic and at people. Sometimes, even if you don't have that diagnosis, you still benefit from it. Like Gladys was saying, \"Thank you for the opportunity to share.\" Then, allow me again and again to thank you so much for one accepting to. Share your story. I know some parents may not feel at ease to share to the whole world about what they are going through, but thank you so much. I know this is a message that is going to open up a lot of parents' understanding of the misconceptions they have. Have and just like I said, I don't want to blame parents. I also don't want to blame teachers because a lot of these conditions, especially the ones you don't see, it's really very hard to tell and it's not until you go to the Hospital you diagnose the child and diagnosis of these conditions is not something very cheap. It is my prayer that we get to have this at the back of our mind, even when we don't have money. But at least you understand and you know that these are the ones. Things I need to do. If I get money, I can go and test out my child and trust me. There are schools out there that will accept your child. Let's not be too hard to keep our children home, and just like I said, some of these children are the ones. Ones that will be a break through in your families. We ignore them, we throw them away. We think the ones that we call no more are the ones who are going to help. Trust me, sometimes they are the opposite - they are the very ones that we have thrown away. Away are the very kids that will be backed up in our family. So, let's take them, let's accept them in our schools, in the classrooms, let's treat them equally.
